Building Real-World Scalable Web Apps

Practical Node.js: Building Real-World Scalable Web Apps is a hands-on manual for developing production-ready
web applications and services by leveraging the rich ecosystem of Node.js packages. This is important because real
applications require many components, such as security, deployment, code organization, database drivers, template
engines, and more.

Practical Node.js is a one-stop place for getting started with Express.js 4, Hapi.js,
DerbyJS, Mongoskin, Mongoose, Everyauth, Mocha, Jade, Socket.IO, TravisCI, Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS),
and many others. Most of these items are vital for any serious project.
